# BART Optimization

Welcome to the BART optimization module.

The purpose of this module is to perform detailed code profiling on the BART codebase to identify areas of high memory usage and performance bottlenecks. Thus, there are two directories:

1. `line_profiler`
2. `memray`

## Getting started

Please refer to the `README` files within each of the `line_profiler` and `memray` directories for instructions on the environment setup and how to run the benchmarks.
